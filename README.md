A simple PGP key manager, usable for every person. Can encrypt, decrypt, sign and verify messages. 
Manage key pairs or only store public keys. Give your key (pairs) a name and description, to not forget what they are for.

## Notice
This tool may not be as secure as other tools, so don't manage your very-ultra-private keys with it.
