Welcome to Idiot's PGP. A simple tool that has multiple PGP features
you can easily use, without knowing anything about PGP.
Each key list you manage will have an AES-encrypted master password,
and each private / public key pair in that list, will also need
a secret key when you use it. Public keys solely won't need a password.

On the left side you can see the key list. Blue keys are public keys,
golden keys are private keys. On the right side you can see the editor panel.
Here you can write text, encrypt, sign, and so on.
The action buttons can be hovered, to get information about what they do.

You can verify this message using the public key on the left
by clicking on "Clear Verify".

Have fun enjoying privacy.
